# Hilo Specification Game
Are you willing to risk everything? Play the Hilo Specification Game and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. Guess whether your next card will be higher or
lower. Each one right is worth 100 points and if your wrong it takes away 75 points. You can always try again until your score hits zero. If not the game is over.
